SVG Gobbler is a simple browser extension that highlights any available SVG content in your current window and lets you download it. The extension is available (soon) on the extension store.

## Developer mode

If you would like to modify this extension, you will need to install it manually.

### :wrench: Side load

1. Download or clone the repo to your local machine
2. In Chrome or Brave browser address bar, navigate to `chrome://extensions`
3. In the top right of the screen, flip the toggle to enable `Developer Mode`
4. Click the button to `Load unpacked` and select the cloned `SVGeezy` folder

### :thumbsup: Contribute back

Feel free to submit a pull request if you've made an improvement of some kind. This is a small hobby project and I am not very good at javascript. 

#### Permissions

The extension requires permission to read and modify all the data of the website that you want to extrach the svg files from. It is nessesary to parse and extract the svg assets on the site.

#### About

This started as a pet project to improve the [SVG Crowbar](http://nytimes.github.com/svg-crowbar/) tool that is no longer being maintained by NY Times. It has come a long way since then but I always appreciated the simplistic approach they started and it's nice to pay homage.
